# Upgrading Recording Studio MCP

## 0.29.0

No MCP protocol migration. Optional MCP `outputSchema` may appear on `tools/list`.
Docs `tags` are on `x-mcp.tools[]` only. They are not part of the protocol tool
payload.

Mounted docs (`recording_studio_mcp_docs_for`) now group tools in the Redoc sidebar
and show each type's operations, writable fields, and capability actions on the
type schema. The page overview is human Markdown. Initialize `instructions` sent
to MCP clients are unchanged in meaning.

If you displayed `info.description` as the agent instruction dump, read
`x-mcp.instructions` instead.

Endpoint tools include `outputSchema` only when that endpoint's `openapi` hash
already has a 2xx `application/json` object schema (`200`, then other 2xx, then
`2XX`). Error, default, array-root, and `$ref`-only schemas are skipped.
`RecordingStudioApi.register_endpoint` still has no dedicated response-schema
argument. Do not add one in this gem.
